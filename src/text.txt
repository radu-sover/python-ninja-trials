In the mid-20th century, three British astrophysicists, [[Stephen Hawking]], [[George F. R.

Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.<ref name="hubble">

Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and indeed, speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].<ref>

The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The [[Lambda-CDM model]] is the standard model of Big Bang cosmology, the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation.

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.<ref name="kolb_c7">Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7</ref> After about 10<sup>?11</sup> seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle physics]] experiments. At about 10<sup>?6</sup> seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10<sup>10</sup> of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10<sup>9</sup>; SI prefix [[giga-]]) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].<ref name="kolb_c4"/> Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]].

Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.<ref name="peebles" />

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modelled by the ?CDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10<sup>?15</sup> seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Underlying assumptions ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].
 
These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10<sup>?5</sup>.<ref>

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10<sup>?5</sup> via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.<ref>

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.<ref>

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.<ref name=HTUW/> Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.<ref>Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]</ref>

===Horizons===
{{Main|Cosmological horizon}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[Particle horizon#Particle horizon|horizons]]. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe. Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.<ref name="kolb_c3">Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3</ref>

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.<ref>

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].<ref>

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.<ref>

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|mm|sing=on}} Hooker telescope at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher.

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:<ref name="hubble" />
:''v'' = ''H''<sub>0</sub>''D'',
where
* ''v'' is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* ''D'' is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* ''H''<sub>0</sub> is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.<ref name="wmap7year" />

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922<ref name=af1922 /> and Georges Lemaître in 1927,<ref name=gl1927 /> well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation ''v'' = ''HD'' to hold at all times, where ''D'' is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and ''v'', ''H'', and ''D'' vary as the universe expands (hence we write ''H''<sub>0</sub> to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity ''v''. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.<ref name="peacock_c3">Peacock (1999), chapter 3</ref>

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],<ref name="hubble" /> supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.<ref>

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.<ref name="penzias" /> Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions: the radiation was found to be consistent with an almost perfect black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles. Peaking at around {{val|372|14|u=kyr}},<ref name="WMAP2003Spergel" /> the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989 [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE). Its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the CMB, finding a residual temperature of 2.726&nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.725&nbsp;K) and providing the first evidence for fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 10<sup>5</sup>.<ref name="cobe" /> [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the Nobel Prize for their leadership in this work. During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=A.

In early 2003 the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.<ref name="wmap1year" /> The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.<ref name = "kolb_c4"/> The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|4}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}, about 10<sup>?3</sup> for {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}, about 10<sup>?4</sup> for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}} and about 10<sup>?9</sup> for {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|7}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}.<ref name="kolb_c4">Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4</ref>

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|4}}, and off by a factor of two for {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|7}}; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.<ref>

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.<ref>

In 2011 astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas, by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.<ref>

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.<ref>

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.<ref name=autogenerated1>Kolb and Turner, chapter 6</ref> It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot, it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].<ref name="sakharov">

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".<ref name="peebles">{{cite journal|author=Peebles, P. J. E. and Ratra, Bharat |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P}}</ref> Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.<ref name="peebles" /> Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a [[cosmological constant]] and [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.<ref name="wmap7year" /> According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|375px|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and 80s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.<ref>

===Horizon problem===
{{Main|Horizon problem}}
The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.<ref name="kolb_c8">Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8</ref> The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.<ref name="Ryden2003">{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}</ref>{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.<ref name="guth"/>{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.<ref name="Ryden2003"/>{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 =D.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.<ref name="guth"/>{{rp|180–186}}

===Flatness problem===
{{Main|Flatness problem}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|275px|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]].<ref name="kolb_c8"/> The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''. The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.<ref group="notes">Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years, before the dark energy density became significant.</ref> Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10<sup>?43</sup> seconds,<ref name=HTUW/> the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation.

===Magnetic monopoles===
{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}
The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s.

These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.<ref name="kolb_c8"/>

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.<ref name="kolb_c3"/> Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].<ref>{{cite web | last =Griswold | first =Britt | title =What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? | work =Universe 101 Big Bang Theory  | publisher =NASA | date =2012 | url =http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}</ref> Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.<ref name=dying>{{cite journal|title=A dying universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects|author=Fred C. Adams and Gregory Laughlin|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=337–372 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.</ref>{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ?CDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].<ref>

==Before: Speculative physics beyond the Big Bang theory==
{{Main|cosmogony}}
{{see also|Planck epoch}}

[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|right|350px|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the [[metric expansion of space]], where space (including hypothetical non-observable portions of the universe) is represented at each time by the circular sections. Note on the left the dramatic expansion (not to scale) occurring in the inflationary epoch, and at the center the expansion acceleration. The scheme is decorated with [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] images on the left and with the representation of stars at the appropriate level of development.]]

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang Theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified.

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be [[essential singularity|singularity]] is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].<ref>

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.<ref>

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.<ref>

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.<ref>
